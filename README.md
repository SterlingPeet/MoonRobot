# MoonRobot

This a Robot Demo for running cFS on a Pi-compatible Linux platform.  The goal is to illustrate how to set up a cFS project in a tangible way for people getting started using the framework.

## Pololu Romi

The Romi was selected as the plaftorm for this project, largely because the parts are available and easily purchased.  Specific consideration was given to minimizing the amount design work and striving for relatively low assembly difficulty, in order to focus on the software learning.

## Software Architecture

Using the cFS paradigm, everything is corraled into apps, stored within the apps folder.  The different functionality of the robot is broken up into different apps, to maximize re-usability and minimize the inter-dependency.

There is only one demo app, due to time constraints for building multiple apps in time for the live demo.
